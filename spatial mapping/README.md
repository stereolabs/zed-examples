# Stereolabs ZED - Spatial Mapping

This sample shows how to capture a real-time 3D map of the scene with the ZED API. It demonstrates how to:
- Start spatial mapping to capture the surrounding area.
- Display the live reconstruction as a wireframe mesh over the image using OpenGL.
- Process and save the mesh in OBJ format.
- Use the lower-level API to asynchronously capture, update and display the mesh.
- Access and retrieve chunks of the entire mesh.

## Getting started

- First, download the latest version of the ZED SDK on [stereolabs.com](https://www.stereolabs.com).
- For more information, read the ZED [API documentation](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/documentation/API/).
