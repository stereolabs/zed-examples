# Stereolabs ZED - Depth Sensing with Streaming

This sample captures a 3D point cloud and display it in an OpenGL window. It shows how to:
- Get a 3D point cloud with the API.
- Display point cloud in OpenGL.
- Use a thread to capture the point cloud and update the GL window simultaneously.
- Use streaming input mode. Need ZED_Streaming_Sender to operate.

To retrieve a depth map of the scene, see [Depth Sensing](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-examples/tree/master/tutorials) tutorial.
