# Stereolabs ZED - Positional Tracking

This sample shows how to track camera motion in space and display it in an OpenGL window. It demonstrates how to:

- Get position and orientation of the device using the API
- Select your coordinate system, frames and units
- Tranform pose data at the center of the camera
- Write pose data and timestamps in a CSV file
- Display camera motion in an OpenGL window

## Getting started

- First, download the latest version of the ZED SDK on [stereolabs.com](https://www.stereolabs.com).
- For more information, read the ZED [API documentation](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/documentation/API/).

*NOTE:* ZED camera tracking is based on stereo vision only. Quick and sudden camera movements can be difficult to track if the image is too blurry or there is no visual information in the scene. To improve tracking performance, we recommend using the ZED in HD720 mode at 60fps.
